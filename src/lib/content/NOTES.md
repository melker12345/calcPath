# Dynamic Content Architecture - Working Notes

## Current Content Shape Inventory (as of start of this branch)

### Core Data Types (from src/lib/)

**Problem** (shared-types.ts)
- id: string (CRITICAL - used in progress tracking)
- topicId: string
- section: string (must match ModuleSection.section)
- prompt: string
- type: "numeric" | "mcq"
- answer: string
- choices?: string[]
- explanation: string (contains "Step X:" and "Final answer:")
- difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard"

**Topic** (shared-types.ts)
- id, title, description, order, estimatedMinutes

**ModuleSection** (modules/types.ts)
- title
- section?: string (stable slug, must match Problem.section)
- body: string[]
- eli5?: string[]
- examples?: WorkedExample[]

**ModuleContent**
- topicId
- title
- intro: string[]
- sections: ModuleSection[]
- examples: WorkedExample[]
- commonMistakes: string[]

**SubjectConfig** (subjects.ts)
- slug, label, shortDescription, modulesDescription, icon, order, hasTests
- topics: Topic[]
- problems: Problem[]
- modules: SubjectModule[] (currently just { topicId, sections: [...] } for deep linking)

### Critical Behaviors That Depend on Current Shapes

1. **Progress Tracking** (`progress.ts`)
   - `completedProblemIds: string[]`
   - `recordAttempt` uses `attempt.problemId`
   - Per-section progress derives from matching `problem.section` against module sections

2. **Answer Checking** (`answer-check.ts`)
   - `isAnswerCorrectAsync(userInput, expected)`
   - Has special normalization, math expression equivalence, numeric tolerance
   - Currently not easily configurable from data

3. **Practice Pages**
   - Still have some subject-specific logic (especially Calculus)
   - `MathInput` receives `subject` prop for context suggestions
   - Various `getHint()`, `finalAnswer` extraction from explanation text

4. **Deep Linking**
   - `getModuleSectionUrl(topicId, section)` relies on `sectionToAnchor` maps + module data

## Open Questions for Schema v1

- How do we represent answer validation rules per question? (inline? separate validator registry?)
- Should `explanation` stay as a single rich string, or be structured (steps + finalAnswer)?
- Do we need a `Chapter` level between Subject and Topic?
- How will we handle "hasTests", subject-specific icons, etc.?

## Next Experiments

- [ ] Try loading one existing topic (e.g. "determinants") purely from data
- [ ] Prototype a generic practice page that works from `Problem[]`
- [ ] Decide on stable ID policy for migrated content
